Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity.

The word steganography is of Greek origin and means "concealed writing" from the Greek words steganos (στεγανός) meaning "covered or protected", and graphei (γραφή) meaning "writing". - Wikipedia

StegTonic uses the popular LSB method to hide data within pixels but spreads the message randomly across the whole image making it harder to preform stegaanalysis.
